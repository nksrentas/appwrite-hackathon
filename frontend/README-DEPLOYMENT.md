# EcoTrace Deployment Guide

## Current Status

Your EcoTrace application has been built and is ready for deployment. Due to Appwrite hosting plan limitations, here are alternative deployment options:

## Files Ready for Deployment

1. **Landing Page**: `landing.html` - A comprehensive showcase of your project
2. **Full Application**: `public/build/` - Complete React/Remix application
3. **Build Archive**: `build.zip` - Compressed build assets

## Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your `public` folder
3. Your site will be live at `https://[random-name].netlify.app`

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel --cwd public`
3. Follow the prompts

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload the `public` folder contents
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

### Option 4: Surge.sh
1. Install Surge: `npm install -g surge`
2. Run: `surge public/`
3. Choose a domain name

## Current Appwrite Storage URLs

While not ideal for production, your files are available at:

- **Landing Page**: https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1/storage/buckets/ecotrace-site/files/landing/view?project=68bf3f5e00183c7886b0
- **Build Assets**: https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1/storage/buckets/ecotrace-site/files/build-assets/download?project=68bf3f5e00183c7886b0

## For Your Hackathon Submission

**Recommended approach**: Deploy to Netlify for the cleanest experience, then use that URL.

**Current working URL**: The Appwrite storage URL above (displays as plain text but contains your beautiful landing page HTML)
